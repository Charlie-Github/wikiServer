The fruit's name comes from ahuacatl, the Nahuatl word for ''testicle,'' which is assumed to be a reference to the avocado's shape. Florida was the site of the first U.S. avocado trees in the 1830s but almost 80 percent of today's crop comes from California. Known early on as alligator pear, the many varieties of today's avocado can range from round to pear-shaped. The skin can be thick to thin, green to purplish black and smooth to corrugated. The flesh is generally a pale yellow-green and softly succulent. The two most widely marketed avocado varieties are the pebbly textured, almost black <b>Hass</b> and the green <b>Fuerte,</b> which has a thin, smooth skin. Depending on the variety, an avocado can weigh as little as 3 ounces and as much as 4 pounds. There are even tiny Fuerte <b>cocktail avocados</b> (also called avocaditos) that are the size of a small gherkin and weigh about 1 ounce. Like many fruits, avocados ripen best off the tree. Ripe avocados yield to gentle palm pressure, but firm, unripe avocados are what are usually found in the market. Select those that are unblemished and heavy for their size. To speed the ripening process, place several avocados in a paper bag and set aside at room temperature for 2 to 4 days. Ripe avocados can be stored in the refrigerator several days. Once avocado flesh is cut and exposed to the air it tends to discolor rapidly. To minimize this effect it is always advisable to add cubed or sliced avocado to a dish at the last moment. When a dish containing mashed avocado, such as guacamole, is being prepared, the addition of lemon or lime juice helps to prevent discoloration. (It is not true that burying the avocado pit in the guacamole helps maintain good color.) Avocados are at their buttery best in raw preparations; cooking them longer than a few minutes diminishes their delicate flavor and can turn them bitter. Though avocados are high in unsaturated fat, the California Avocado Advisory Board states that half of an 8-ounce avocado contains only 138 calories. In addition, avocados contain a fair amount of vitamin C, thiamine and riboflavin.");

Vinegar has been used for centuries for everything from beverages (like shrubs) to an odor diminisher for strong foods such as cabbage and onions to a hair rinse and softener. There are myriad vinegar varieties found in markets today. From Italy comes the exquisite Italian balsamic vinegar made in and around the areas of Modena and Reggio Emilia. It's produced from white Trebbiano grapes, the must of which is cooked and concentrated until deep, dark and rich. The vinegar continues to gain its dark color and pungent sweetness from a lengthy period of aging in barrels of various woods (such as chestnut, juniper and mulberry) and in graduating sizes, from larger to smaller, as the vinegar ages over a period of years. It should be noted that many balsamic vinegars contain sulfites, which are primarily added to inhibit the growth of unfavorable, flavor-detracting bacteria. Balsamic vinegars range in age from young (three to five years) to middle-aged (six to 12 years) to the noble older versions, which can range from 12 to more than 100 years old. By law a vinegar labeled <em>aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena</em> must have been wood-aged for a minimum of 12 years. The word <em>stravecchio</em> on the label tells you the balsamic's been aged at least 25 years. Older, high-quality balsamics are sometimes used as an aperitif or digestif after a meal. White balsamic vinegar also comes from Modena, Italy, but is made by an entirely different process than classic balsamic vinegar. The grape undergoes pressurized cooking, which prevents the caramelization of both flavor and color. White balsamic vinegar is aged only one year in uncharred barrels, further assuring both color and flavor will remain light. It's used in food preparations where additional color is not desired.");

The wide popularity of Bordeaux wines in the United Kingdom (where they're called clarets) can be traced back to the period from 1152 to 1453 when the English owned this regionacquired through a royal marriage then lost in the 100 Years' War. The most celebrated of the Bordeaux wines are the reds, which make up more than 75 percent of the production. Nevertheless, the region's rich, sweet white wines from sauternes are world-renowned, and its dry white wines from Graves have a serious following. The five main Bordeaux districts with individual appellations are Pomerol, Saint-Emilion, Graves, Sauternes and the Médoc (which has many individual appellations including Margaux, Pauillac, Saint-Estephe and Saint-Julien). The primary red grape varieties used in Bordeaux are cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot (with almost twice as much acreage as Cabernet Sauvignon), and occasionally Malbec and Petit Verdot. The primary white grapes are sauvignon blanc, sémillon and Muscadelle. Bordeaux winemakers typically blend grape varieties for their wines, as opposed to the prevailing practice in the United States of producing varietal wines. It should be noted, however, that American vintners are now making more blended wines, which are called meritage wines when approved Bordeaux grape varieties are used. In general, the vineyards of Saint-Emilion and Pomerol are planted more heavily in Merlot and thus produce softer, more supple wines. On the other hand, the vineyards of Medoc and Graves favor Cabernet varieties, which create more intense, tannic (see tannin) and long-lived wines. Some of the more famous châteaux in Bordeaux are Haut-Brion, Lafite-Rothschild, Latour, Margaux, Mouton Rothschild and Petrus.");

The top is twisted closed and the pouch is dipped in brine. The cream thickens inside the bag, which produces a soft, rich center with a fresh milky quality that oozes out when the cheese is cut.

This compares to the saturated fat content of peanut oil (about 18 percent) and palm oil (at an incredibly high 79 percent). Another canola oil selling point is that it contains more cholesterol-balancing monounsaturated fat than any oil except olive oil. It also has the distinction of containing Omega-3 fatty acids, the wonder polyunsaturated fat reputed to not only lower both cholesterol and triglycerides but to contribute to brain growth and development as well. The bland-tasting canola oil is suitable both for cooking and for salad dressings.");

Caviar production is a major industry for both countries. Beluga caviar is prized for its soft, extremely large (pea-size) eggs. It can range in color from pale silver-gray to black. Next in quality is the medium-size, gray to brownish gray osetra, and the smaller, gray sevruga caviar. The small, golden <b>sterlet</b> caviar is so rare that it was once reserved for Russian czars, Iranian shahs and Austrian emperors. Other popular (and much less expensive) types include <b>lumpfish caviar</b> (tiny, hard, black eggs), <b>whitefish caviar</b> (also called <em>American Golden</em>) with its small yellow-gold eggs and  or <b>red caviar</b> (medium-size, pale orange to deep red eggs). The word  on the label doesn't describe the type of caviar but rather the fact that the roe is preserved with a minimum amount of salt; <em>malossol</em> is Russian for ''little salt.'' Caviar is extremely perishable and must be refrigerated from the moment it's taken from the fish to the time it's consumed. <b>Pasteurized caviar</b> is roe that has been partially cooked, thereby giving the eggs a slightly different texture. It's less perishable and may be stored at room temperature before opening. Once opened, refrigerate for no more than 3 days. <b>Pressed caviar</b> is composed of damaged or fragile eggs and can be a combination of several different roes. It's specially treated, salted and pressed, and can in no way be compared to fresh caviar. Be sure to read the label for information on how to handle the caviar you purchase. In general, store unopened fresh caviar in the refrigerator for up to a month; consume within 3 days of opening. Although only a spoonful of caviar supplies the adult daily requirement of vitamin B, it's also high in cholesterol and loaded with salt. Serve caviar very cold, preferably in a bowl surrounded by ice. Because silver and steel bowls may alter the flavor of caviar, it's classically served in containers made of mother-of-pearl, wood, horn or gold. Caviar should be presented simply, with toast points and lemon wedges. If desired, it may be accompanied by sour cream, minced onion and hard-cooked egg whites and yolks, garnishes purists deem unnecessary. Two classic caviar accompaniments are iced vodka and Champagne. Cooking greatly diminishes the flavor and texture of caviar, so add it to a hot dish just before serving, stirring gently to keep the eggs from breaking.

Most countries bow to this tradition by calling their sparkling wines by other names such as <em>spumante</em> in Italy, <em>Sekt </em>in Germany and <em>vin mousseux</em> in other regions of France. Only in America do some wineries refer to their bubbling wine as ''champagne.'' Dom Perignon, 17th-century cellarmaster of the Abbey of Hautvillers, is celebrated for developing the art of blending wines to create Champagnes with superior flavor. He's also credited for his work in preventing Champagne bottles and corks from exploding by using thicker bottles and tying the corks down with string. Even then, it's said that the venerable Dom Perignon lost half his Champagne through the bottles bursting. French Champagne is usually made from a blend of chardonnay and pinot noir or pinot blanc grapes. California ''champagnes'' generally use the same varieties, while those from New York more often are from the pressings of catawba and delaware grapes. Good Champagne is expensive not only because it's made with premium grapes, but because it's made by the <em>méthode champenoise</em>. This traditional method requires a second fermentation in the bottle as well as some 100 manual operations (some of which are mechanized today). Champagnes can range in color from pale gold to apricot blush. Their flavors can range from toasty to yeasty and from dry (no sugar added) to sweet. A sugar-wine mixture called a dosage added just before final corking determines how sweet a Champagne will be. The label indicates the level of sweetness: <b>brut</b> (bone dry to almost dry  less than 1.5 percent sugar); <b>extra sec </b>or <b>extra dry</b> (slightly sweeter  1.2 to 2 percent sugar); <b>sec</b> (medium sweet  1.7 to 3.5 percent sugar); <b>demi-sec</b> (sweet  3.3 to 5 percent sugar); and <b>doux</b> (very sweet  over 5 percent sugar).

Today there are a precious few British farmstead cheddar cheesemakers left and most of this cheese is factory produced in the U.K. and elsewhere. Unlike the names of many European cheeses, that of cheddar is not protected. And the truth is, the word ''cheddar'' no longer refers to just the name of the English village, but rather to the pressing process by which the cheese is made. With this technique, known as <b>cheddaring</b>, slabs of partially drained curd are stacked on top of each other and turned and restacked every 10 to 15 minutes for up to 1½ hours, which ensures that all slabs are evenly pressed. This produces a cheese with the characteristically smooth, tight texture of cheddar, cheshire and lancashire. Cheddar is now the most widely made cheese in the world, with production in myriad countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Scotland, South Africa, Sweden and the United States. Though factory-produced cheddars abound, there has been a renaissance of traditional cheesemaking in the U.K., United States, Australia and elsewhere. Cheddar can be made from raw or pasteurized cow's milk and can range in texture from semihard to hard. This cheese comes in a variety of sizes and shapes including rectangles and small wheels. Factory-produced cheddar is typically rindless and comes wrapped in plastic or covered with wax; the interior can range from off-white to orange. Farmstead cheeses have rinds that can range in color from golden brown to grayish brown; the paste varies from ivory to pale yellow. One signal of handmade cheddar is that it's wrapped in cloth. Another is that it isn't dyed orange with annatto. Texture-wise, cheddar is smooth and tight. Factory-produced cheeses are typically slick and can be slightly gummy; those that are handmade are generally somewhat crumbly or flaky. The flavor of factory cheddars can range from bland to sharp, while farmstead versions are full and complex with notes of caramel, fruit, nuts and spice. On the whole, mass-produced cheddars are second-rate compared to traditional handmade versions. In general, cheddars are labeled with four ripening designations: mild (about 2 to 4 months), medium (4 to 8 months), sharp (9 to 12 months), and extra-sharp (aged over 1 year). That's a very broad spectrum, however, and aging times for cheddars can vary widely, depending on the producer, many of which openly indicate the length of time the cheese has been ripened. ");

Mention of coriander seeds was found in early Sanskrit writings, and the seeds themselves have been discovered in Egyptian tombs dating to 960 B.C. The tiny (1⁄8-inch) yellow-tan seeds are lightly ridged. They are mildly fragrant and have an aromatic flavor akin to a combination of lemon, sage and caraway. Whole coriander seeds are used in pickling and for special drinks, such as mulled wine. Ground seed is used in many baked goods (particularly Scandinavian), curry blends, soups, etc. Both forms are commonly available in supermarkets. <b>Coriander leaves</b> are commonly known as <em>cilantro</em> and <em>Chinese parsley</em>. They have an extremely pungent (some say fetid) odor and flavor that lends itself well to highly seasoned food. Though it's purported to be the world's most widely used herb, many Americans and Europeans find that fresh coriander is definitely an acquired taste. Choose leaves with an even green color and no sign of wilting. Store a bunch of coriander, stems down, in a glass of water with a plastic bag over the leaves.

The thin, hard rind ranges in color from pale yellow to yellow-brown and the ivory-yellow interior has a supple, smooth texture and a random scattering of cherry- to walnut-size eyes. Emmental has a buttery, delicately sweet, earthy, fruity flavor. Young examples have notes of hazelnut, aged versions become spicy. Authentic Emmentals will always have the words ''Emmental'' and ''Switzerland'' stamped on the rind. Minimum ripening time is 4 months, 8 months for ''mature,'' and 12 months or more for ''fully mature.'' <b>French Emmental</b> has been made for almost as long as the Swiss original and the recipes and production methods are primarily the same, though French versions are mostly factory-produced. Whereas regular French Emmental is based on pasteurized milk, those labeled <em>Emmental Grand Cru</em> are made with raw milk.

That's because most non-Swiss versions are factory-produced with pasteurized milk, whereas AOC standards for Swiss Gruyères say they can only be made from the raw milk of two milkings of cows fed only grass or hay (no silage) and must be prepared in copper pots. There are three types of Gruyère AOC: <em>Classic</em> (ripened for a minimum of 5 months), <em>Réserve</em> (10 to 16 months) and <em>d'Alpage</em>, which is made only from April through October from milk produced by cows grazing in high Alpine pastures.");

Cover the top of the bouquet with a plastic bag, securing it to the glass with a rubber band. Alternatively, the herb bouquet may be placed in a screw-top jar in the same manner and sealed tightly.

The air and light in a hydroponic enclosure is strictly controlled to ensure optimal production. Increased yields are further ensured because hydroponically grown vegetables can be planted much closer together than those in the field. Yet another bonus is that hydroponic farmers are not besieged by weeds and pests, which means their crops are pesticide free.

The off-white to pale yellow interior is smooth and elastic and can range from semisoft to semihard, depending on age. Younger versions of Kasseri have a flavor that's delicate, sweet and tangy, while aged cheeses become salty and piquant.

Today's extraordinarily pungent spicy-hot condiment is served at almost every Korean meal, though kimchi is fast becoming popular in many upscale restaurants as well as with health-food enthusiasts. Kimchi is comprised of a combination of vegetables (such as cabbage, carrots, radishes or turnips) and flavorings such as garlic, ginger and green onions. Sometimes small pieces of fish (such as baby shrimp or anchovies) are added to the mix. The ingredients are pickled together before being fermented. There are hundreds of kimchi recipes, which vary from region to region and change seasonally, depending on what fresh ingredients are available. In Korea, for example, wintertime kimchi is based primarily on chinese cabbage and has very hearty characteristics that Koreans savor during the long, cold months. On the other hand, summer foods such as radishes and cucumbers create lighter, fresher kimchi flavors for hotter weather. Kimchi is also used as a component for soup, rice and other dishes. Commercial kimchi can be purchased in Korean markets and natural food stores. It's usually in glass jars in the refrigerated section, and it will keep indefinitely in the fridge. Koreans use <b>kimchi paste</b> (also called <em>gochujang</em>) as a seasoning when making kimchi and as a table condiment to flavor dishes.

Quality brands are typically flavored with the finest ingredients, essential oils and extracts; less expensive examples often use artificial flavorings. <b>Cream liqueurs</b> are flavored mixtures that have been homogenized with cream. They have a rich mixture that's velvety smooth and creamy, and they require no refrigeration. <b>Crème liqueurs</b> (such as crème de menthe) are distinguished by being sweet and syrupy. Liqueurs range widely in alcohol content, generally from about 15 percent (for some irish cream liqueurs) to 55 percent (green chartreuse), although a few ''baby liqueurs'' like Kahlúa Mudslide contain only 6.5 percent alcohol. Although the word ''liqueur'' is common usage today, such potables are also called <em>cordials</em> and, less frequently, <em>ratafias.</em> Liqueurs were originally used (and some still are) as a digestive. They are now usually served after dinner but also play an important role in many cocktails. Liqueurs can also be used in cooking, particularly for desserts. ");

It's also dried and processed into flour, which is used as a substitute for wheat flour. Like taro root leaves, those of the malanga are called <em>callaloo</em> in the Caribbean.

Now this delectable fruit is cultivated in temperate climates around the world, including California and Florida. There are many species of mango, which come in a wide variety of shapes (oblong, kidney and round) and sizes (from about six ounces to four pounds). Depending on the variety, their skin color can range from yellow-orange to yellow-green to yellow with brilliant red blushing. The fragrant flesh is a brilliant golden orange, exceedingly juicy and exotically sweet and tart. Perhaps the only negative to the mango is the huge, flat seed that traverses its length. Mangoes are in season from May to September, though imported fruit can be found throughout the remainder of the year. Look for fruit with an unblemished, yellow skin blushed with red. Because the seed is so oversized, the larger the mango the higher the fruit-to-seed ratio. Underripe fruit can be placed in a paper bag at room temperature. Ripe mangoes can be placed in a plastic bag and held refrigerated for up to five days. Mangoes must be peeled and the fruit carefully carved away from the large seed. To do this, stand the fruit on its wide end and use a sharp knife to vertically cut away the fruit, sliding the knife along the seed on one side, then repeating on the other. You'll have to guess about where the seed is. This will give you two large pieces. Then cut away the remaining flesh and use as desired. <em>Or,</em> you can peel the mango and use a gadget called a ''mango pitter,'' which handles the job in one stroke. Mangoes need no embellishment and are delicious simply peeled and eaten plain. They're also wonderful in fruit salads, smoothies, salsas, desserts and chutneys. Mango can also be chopped and added to cooked foods such as rice or stir-fry dishes just before serving. Fresh mangoes are rich in vitamins A and C. <b>Canned mangoes</b> and <b>mango nectar</b> are available in many supermarkets. <b>Mango purée </b>or<b> pulp</b> can be found fresh in some natural food stores as well as Indian and Latin markets, and frozen in some supermarkets.

His creation was the result of a contest promoted by the Emperor Napoleon III to find an inexpensive alternative for the then scarce and expensive butter. Although the original version included beef fat renderings, today's margarines are based on vegetable oils. In order for margarine to become solid, the oil must undergo a chemical transformation known as hydrogenation  indicated as ''hydrogenated'' (or ''partially hydrogenated'') oils on a label. During hydrogenation, extra hydrogen atoms are pumped into unsaturated fat, a process that creates trans fatty acids and converts the mixture into a saturated fat, thereby obliterating any benefits it had as a polyunsaturate. Some researchers believe that hydrogenated oils may actually be more damaging than regular saturated fats for those limiting cholesterol in their diets, but the jury's still out on that debate. Those margarines lowest in cholesterol are made from a high percentage of polyunsaturated canola, safflower or corn oil. To make this butter substitute taste and look more like the real thing, cream or milk is often added. Food coloring, preservatives, emulsifiers and vitamins A and D are also common additives. Careful label scrutiny is advised because the ingredients affect everything from flavor to texture to nutritive value. <b>Regular margarine</b> must contain 80 percent fat. The remaining 20 percent consists of liquid, coloring, flavoring and other additives. Margarine is available salted and unsalted. So are <b>butter-margarine blends,</b> which are usually proportioned 40 percent to 60 percent, respectively. <b>Cholesterol-lowering margarines</b> hit the market in 1999. These ''miracle margarines'' contain no hydrogenated trans fatty acids and are typically made from a blend of oils such as palm oil, soybean oil, canola oil and olive oil. They can lower cholesterol levels in the blood by as much as 10 percent, with each percentage point creating a 3 percent drop in the risk of heart disease. They're made with plant-derived compounds (sterol and stanol esters) that obstruct cholesterol absorption. <b>Soft margarine</b> is made with all vegetable oils (no animal fats) and remains soft and spreadable when cold. <b>Whipped margarine</b> has had air (which sometimes can equal half the volume) beaten into it, making it fluffy and easy to spread. Because of the added air, it cannot be substituted for regular margarine in baked goods. So-called <b>liquid margarine</b> is soft enough to be squeezable when cold and comes in pliable bottles made specifically for that purpose. It's convenient for basting and for foods such as corn on the cob and waffles. There are also many <b>reduced-fat margarines</b> on the market today. These products range from about 25 percent to 65 percent less fat than regular margarine. There's even <b>fat-free margarine,</b> the ingredients of which include gelatin, rice starch and lactose. The first ingredient listed on reduced-fat margarine labels is <em>water,</em> which means they can't be substituted for regular margarine for baking and frying, and which also means they can make toast soggy. Margarine comes in 1-pound packages  either in four (4-ounce) sticks or in two (8-ounce) tubs. It's also available in 1-pound tubs. All margarine readily absorbs flavors and therefore should be wrapped airtight for storage. Refrigerate margarine for up to two months; freeze for up to six months.

Over the years, that early four-component martinez recipe has transitioned into a two-ingredient, much drier martini, which replaces its predecessor's slight sweetness with an icy austerity. At the beginning of the 19th century, when popular usage of the word ''martini'' took hold, the drink's proportions were equal parts gin and dry vermouth. By about 1915, the ratio was two parts gin to one part vermouth, with four-to-one being the norm by World War II. Today it's not uncommon to see ratios of six, eight, twelve or fifteen parts gin to one part vermouth. Bottom line: The less vermouth, the drier the martini.

It was coined by a group of vintners who sought to establish standards of identification for a category of American blended wines made with traditional bordeaux grape varieties. The Meritage Association was formed to help identify quality American wine blends that, because they're not made with at least 75 percent of a single variety, can't use the variety name on the label. This forced many producers of excellent wines to either use generic names (like claret or Red Table Wine) or proprietary names (like the Joseph Phelps Vineyards <em>Insignia</em>)practices that caused great confusion in the marketplace. To be designated as Meritage, a wine must meet the following standards: 1. It must be a blend of two or more Bordeaux grape varietiesfor red wines these are Cabernet Franc, cabernet sauvignon, Carmenere, Gros Verdot, Malbec, merlot, petite verdot and St. Macaire, and for whites they're sauvignon blanc, muscadet and sémillon (no more than 90 percent of any single variety may go into a Meritage wine); 2. It must be the winery's best wine of its type; 3. It must be produced and bottled by a U.S. winery from grapes that carry a U.S. appellation; and 4. Its production is limited to a maximum 25,000 cases per vintage. Wineries that are approved for the Meritage designation may use it in various ways on the label. They may simply use the word Meritage alone, or Meritage in conjunction with their own proprietary name (as with <em>Cardinale</em> from Kendall-Jackson Vineyards) or use only their proprietary name.");

After the wines are blended, a bottling dosage and special yeasts are added, and the cuvée is immediately bottled and corked. The yeast and sugar in the dosage create a secondary fermentation in the bottle, producing additional alcohol and carbon dioxide gas, which gives the wine its effervescence. Sediment produced during the second fermentation is removed through riddling (or <em>rémuage</em>), a process by which the bottles are positioned downward at a 45° angle in specially built racks called <em>pupitres</em>. Every 3 or 4 days, a trained workman gives the bottles a shake and a slight turn, gradually increases the angle of tilt, and drops the bottle back in the rack with a slight whack. In 6 to 8 weeks, all the bottles are positioned straight downward and the sediment has collected in the neck. Although riddling was once done entirely by hand, today many wineries employ machines that dramatically shorten this lengthy procedure. After riddling comes disgorging (or <em>dégorgement</em>), whereby the sediment is removed. Just before final bottling, a ''shipping dosage'' () containing sugar and some of the same cuvée (reserved for this purpose) is addedthe percentage of sugar determines the degree of the wine's sweetness. The term ''méthode champenoise'' can be used only on labels of wines made by this method.");

Europeans love mussels, which are cultivated on special farms to meet the high demand. Americans, however, have never been as enamored of mussels as they have of oysters and clams, and huge quantities along U.S. coasts go unharvested. There are dozens of mussel species, all of which have an extremely thin, oblong shell that can range in color from indigo blue to bright green to yellowish-brown. Depending on the species, the shell can be from 1½ to 6 inches in length. The creamy-tan meat is tougher than that of either the oyster or clam but it has a delicious, slightly sweet flavor. The most abundant mussel is the <b>blue</b> (or <b>common</b>)<b> mussel</b> found along the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Its shell is dark blue and 2 to 3 inches in length. The <b>green-lipped mussel</b> is imported from New Zealand (which is why it's also called <em>New Zealand green mussel</em>) and has a large (3 to 4 inches long), bright green shell. Live, fresh mussels are genrally available year-round. On the West Coast, however, the mussel season is November through April. This is because microscopic organisms (of ''red tide'' notoriety) make mussels unsafe to eat during the spring and summer months. Buy mussels with tightly closed shells or those that snap shut when tapped--otherwise they're not alive and fresh. Avoid those with broken shells, that feel heavy (meaning they're full of sand) or that feel light and loose when shaken (signalling that the mussel is dead). Shucked mussels should be plump, their liquid clear. Small mussels will be more tender than large ones. Fresh mussels, live or shucked, should be stored in the refrigerator and used within a day or two. Plain and smoked mussels packed in oil are also available. Mussels may be steamed, fried, baked or used as an ingredient in dishes like bouillabaisse or paella. <em>See also</em> shellfish.");

In fact, archaeological documentation now points to the fact that noodles probably originated in central Asia, possibly dating back to at least 1000 B.C. Almost every country has a form of pasta. The Germans enjoy spaetzle, Poles have their pierogi, and throughout the Orient there are dozens of noodles, usually made with rice or soy flour rather than wheat flour (see Asian noodles). In Italian, the word <em>pasta</em> means ''paste'' and refers to the dough made by combining durum wheat flour, called semolina, with a liquid, usually water or milk. The term <em>pasta</em> is used broadly and generically to describe a wide variety of noodles made from this type of dough. Some doughs have a little egg added, though doughs made with only flour and eggs are generally referred to as noodles. There are hundreds of shapes, sizes, thicknesses and colors of pasta. Macaroni and spaghetti are probably the most popular, though each of those categories has many size and shape varieties. Additionally, there are dozens of fancy shapes such as conchiglie (shells), farfalle (bows) and rotelle (little corkscrews). Other pastas, such as ravioli and tortellini, have fillings. Some pastas are colored, often with spinach (green), beet juice or tomato paste (red) and squid ink (charcoal gray). Pasta also comes in both dried and fresh forms. As a general rule, imported  <b>dried pasta</b> is superior to American factory-made products, mainly because the imported pasta is only made with semolina, which doesn't absorb too much water and is pleasantly firm when cooked al dente. A good selection of dried pastas can be found in most supermarkets, and an even broader variety is available in Italian markets.

Because it's highly perishable, it must be refrigerated airtight and can be stored in this manner for about four days. It can also be frozen for up to a month.

The portobello mushroom, which can easily measure 6 inches in diameter, has an open, flat cap. Because it's the elder of the species, the portobello's gills are fully exposed, which means that some of the mushroom's moisture has evaporated. The reduced moisture concentrates and enriches the flavor and creates a dense, meaty texture. Portobellos can be found in gourmet produce markets as well as many supermarkets. Their stems are very woody and should be removed (but saved for soups, stocks, etc.) The caps can be used chopped, as with most mushrooms, but the portobello is much more dramatic used whole.

They're the only edible portion of the plantthe leaves contain oxalic acid and can therefore be toxic. Though rhubarb is generally eaten as a fruit, it's botanically a vegetable. There are many varieties of this extremely tart food, most of which fall into two basic typeshothouse and field grown. Hothouse rhubarb is distinguished by its pink to pale red stalks and yellow-green leaves, whereas field-grown plants (which are more pronounced in flavor) have cherry red stalks and green leaves. Hothouse rhubarb is available from around December to March, while the field-grown plant can usually be found from March to October, with a peak from April to June. Choose crisp stalks that are brightly hued. The leaves should be fresh-looking and blemish-free. Highly perishable, fresh rhubarb should be refrigerated, tightly wrapped in a plastic bag, for up to 3 days. Wash and remove leaves just before using. Because of its intense tartness, rhubarb is usually combined with a considerable amount of sugar. It makes delicious sauces, jams and desserts and in some regions is also known as <em>pieplant</em> because of its popularity for that purpose. In America, a traditional flavor combination is rhubarb and strawberries; in Britain, rhubarb and ginger. Rhubarb contains a fair amount of vitamin A.");

During reheating, protein particles rise to the surface, are skimmed off, strained and placed in perforated molds or baskets to drain further. The resulting rich, fresh cheese is slightly grainy but smoother than cottage cheese. It's white, moist and has a slightly sweet flavor. Of course, ricotta technically isn't a cheese at all but a ''dairy product'' because neither starter nor rennet is used in the process. <b>Ricotta Romana</b>, also called <em>ricotta gentile</em>, is made in this way using sheep's whey left over from making Pecorino Romano. Some ricottas are made with partially skimmed milk in lieu of whey or with milk added to the whey, resulting in a higher fat content. There are many approaches to making ricotta and myriad variations in both texture and flavor, though all versions are generally fresh, soft and moist. There are exceptions. <b>Ricotta salata</b> is quite different. It's produced in Sicily, Sardinia and several regions of mainland Italy. <em>Salata</em> means ''salty,'' and this cheese is made by salting and pressing fresh ricotta before aging it for about three months. The result is a firm, snow-white cheese that's smooth, pliable and somewhat similar to feta, though not as salty. It has a sweet, milky, slightly nutty flavor. Some ricotta salatas are aged for a year or more until they are hard enough to be grating cheeses. If the word <b>affumicata</b> is used it means the ricotta has been smoked; its exterior will be grayish white to reddish gold to brown. There are myriad smoked versions. For example, <b>ricotta fumo di ginepro</b>, produced in Abruzzo and Molise, is distinctively smoked with juniper wood. <b>Ricotta forte</b> is made by taking leftover fresh ricotta and kneading it periodically for several months before placing it in small clay pots to age for about a year. This results in soft, creamy-brown paste that's exceedingly pungent and piquant. <b>Ricotta infornata</b> is made by baking drained ricotta in a greased pan or clay pot for about a half hour or until the surface begins to brown. The cheese's interior turns pale golden and the exterior a deep golden brown. Ricotta infornata is traditionally eaten fresh, but it's also allowed to age and become hard enough to be used as a grating cheese. <b>American ricottas</b> are typically made with a combination of whey and whole or skim milk, which usually produces a wetter, creamier style of ricotta than Italian versions.

It's a native of Germany, where it's believed to have been cultivated for at least 500  and possibly as long as 2,000  years. Riesling wines are delicate but complex, and characterized by a spicy, fruity flavor, flower-scented bouquet and long finish. Riesling is vinified in a variety of styles ranging from dry to very sweet. In Germany, these sweet wineswhich are usually affected by botrytis cinereaare graded in ascending order of sweetness as Auslese, Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese. California winemakers now produce high-quality German-style Rieslings, which are lighter, more delicate, and slightly to medium-sweet. Because the name ''Riesling'' is used in many ways, it's sometimes difficult to find wines truly made from this variety. In California, for instance, <b>Johannisberg Riesling</b> is the true Riesling, whereas Gray Riesling and Emerald Riesling are actually other varieties. A bottle of California wine labeled simply ''Riesling'' usually means that the wine's made from one of the lesser varieties, not Johannisberg Riesling. Riesling is all peaches and honey, perfect for spicy food, charcuterie and game birds like roast duck and goose.

In fact, some people consider it a beer because it's produced from grain. However, the United States Tax and Trade Bureau (previously the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) has settled any dispute by categorizing sake in Class 6''wine from other agricultural products.'' Sake is made up of rice, water, koji, yeast and sometimes a small amount of distilled alcohol. It's produced in several steps, during which time specially selected rice undergoes fermentation, which converts the starch to sugar and then to alcohol and carbon dioxide. After fermentation, the liquid is drawn off, filtered, heated and transferred to casks for maturing. None of the carbon dioxide is retained so there's no effervescence. The alcohol content of sake ranges from 15 to 19 percent, which is high for beer and low for most grain-based spirits, but in the range of some wines. Though there are myriad types of rice used for brewing sake, what differentiates the various types of sake is how much of each grain of rice is milled or polished away and whether or not distilled alcohol is added to the mix. <b>Seimaibuai,</b> or <b>seimai buai,</b> is the Japanese term for milling, describing how much of the rice grain is polished away or milled, which influences the sake's flavor. Some sake labels list a percentage number, referring to how much of the rice grain is left. Generally, the lower the percentage, the more the rice has been polished away, and the more elegant, refined and high-quality the sake. There are six main styles of sake: <b>junmai</b> has 70 percent remaining rice grain and no added distilled alcoholthe flavor is full, clean and well structured; <b>honjozo</b> has 70 percent residual rice grain and a small amount of added alcoholit's light and mildly fragrant; <b>junmai ginjo </b>has 60 percent remaining rice grain and no distilled alcoholthe flavor is light, fruity and refined; <b>ginjo</b> has 60 percent residual rice grain plus added alcoholthe flavor is light, fruity, aromatic and refined; <b>junmai dai ginjo</b> or<b> junmai daiginjo</b> has 50 percent of the rice hull and no distilled alcoholthe flavor is complex, yet light and fragrant; and <b>dai ginjo </b>or <strong>daiginjo</strong> has 50 percent of the rice hull plus alcohol--a fragrantly light flavor with good complexity. When the word <em>junmai</em> appears alone or in combination with other descriptors, it means the sake has not been supplemented with distilled alcohol. The addition of alcohol is neither good or badit simply produces a slightly different sake, both in texture and in flavor. Because <b>seishu</b> is the legal name for sake, the word <b>shu</b> is officially added to sake terms, as in <em>junami-shu</em> or <em>ginjo-shu</em>. <b>Futsuu-shu </b>is sake that doesn't fit into one of the six previously listed sake categories. Most sake is filtered and clear, but the word <b>nigori </b>denotes sake that is unfiltered and slightly cloudy. <b>Amakuchi</b> describes sake that has a sweet flavor whereas <b>karakuchi </b>refers to one that's dry. Most sake is diluted with a small amount of water so that the alcohol level is 16 percent or less. The term <b>genshu</b> indicates the sake is undiluted and has an alcohol range of 17 to 19 percent. Sake typically is pasteurized twice; unpasteurized versions are labeled <b>nama. </b>Freshly<b> </b>brewed sake that has been stored in cedar tanks is called <b>taru </b>(cedar sake). If sake instead of water is added during the brewing process, the result is <b>kijoshu </b>(dessert sake). Though most sake is not aged longer than the fermentation cycle, <b>koshu</b> is a style specially produced to mature for years, and the sake yellows as it grows older.<b> </b>At one time it was traditional to serve sake warm, but today most premium sake is served either at room temperature or slightly chilled. Lower-end versions are often still warmed to obscure the flavor. Besides being a popular potable, sake is used in Japanese cooking, particularly in sauces and marinades. As with wine, sake begins to degrade as soon as it's opened. Tightly seal, store in the refrigerator and consume as soon as possible.");

Salmon are anadromous, meaning that they migrate from their saltwater habitat to spawn in fresh water. Over the years, some salmon have become landlocked in freshwater lakes. In general, the flesh of those salmon is less flavorful than that of their sea-running relatives. There is an increasing volume of aquacultured salmon being imported into the United States today  most of it from Norway, although Chile's salmon farming industry is now giving the Norwegians some competition. Although farmed salmon are raised in salt water, their flesh doesn't have the same rich nuances in flavor and texture as that of their wild relations. There are several varieties of North American salmon. All but one are found off the Pacific coast, and about 90 percent come from Alaskan waters. Among the best Pacific salmon is the superior <b>Chinook</b> or <b>king salmon,</b> which can reach up to 120 pounds. The color of its high-fat, soft-textured flesh ranges from off-white to bright red. Other high-fat salmon include the <b>coho</b> or <b>silver salmon,</b> with its firm-textured, pink to red-orange flesh, and the <b>sockeye</b> or <b>red salmon</b> (highly prized for canning) with its firm, deep red flesh. Not as fatty as the preceding species are the <b>pink</b> or <b>humpback salmon</b>  the smallest, most delicately flavored of the Pacific varieties  and the <b>chum</b> or <b>dog salmon,</b> which is distinguished by having the lightest color and lowest fat content. Pacific salmon are in season from spring through fall. The population of the once-abundant <b>Atlantic salmon</b> has diminished greatly over the years because of industrial pollution of both North American and European tributaries. The Atlantic salmon has a high-fat flesh that's pink and succulent. Canada provides most of the Atlantic salmon, which is in season from summer to early winter. Depending on the variety, salmon is sold whole or in fillets or steaks. It's also available canned and as smoked salmon, which comes in a variety of styles. The increasingly popular bright red salmon roe is readily available in most supermarkets. Fresh salmon is integral to some of the world's most famous dishes, including gravlax and coulibiac. It can be served as a main course, in salads, as a spread or dip -- its uses are myriad. All salmon are high in protein as well as a rich source of vitamin A, the B-group vitamins and Omega-3 oils.

To illustrate the difference between the terms <em>saturated</em>, <em>monounsaturated</em> and <em>polyunsaturated</em>, picture a fat molecule as a train of passenger cars (carbon atoms). If every seat on the train is filled by a ''passenger'' (hydrogen atom), then this is a saturated fat molecule. If there's one seat open in each car where a hydrogen-atom ''passenger'' can sit, the molecule is monounsaturated; if there are several seats available, it's polyunsaturated. In general, saturated fats come from animal sources and are solid enough to hold their shape at room temperature (about 70 degrees F). Exceptions to this rule are tropical oils such as coconut oil and palm oil, which, though of plant origin, are semisolid at room temperature and highly saturated. Saturated fats are the nutritional ''bad guys'' because they're known to be associated with some forms of cancer and to increase cholesterol levels, which can be a contributing factor to heart disease. In addition to the two aforementioned tropical oils, the most commonly commercially used saturated fats are butter, lard, suet and hydrogenated vegetable oils such as margarine and vegetable shortening. Hydrogenated (or partially hydrogenated) oils have been chemically transformed from their normal liquid state (at room temperature) into solids. During the hydrogenation procedure extra hydrogen atoms are pumped into unsaturated fat. This process creates trans fatty acids, converting the mixture into a saturated fat and obliterating any benefits it had as a polyunsaturate. Some researchers believe that hydrogenated oils may actually be more damaging than regular saturated fats for those limiting cholesterol in their diets. Unsaturated fats are derived primarily from plants and are liquid (in the form of an oil) at room temperature. Generally speaking, oils are composed (in varying percentages) of both monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Monounsaturated fats are known to help reduce the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol. The three most widely used oils that are high in monounsaturates are olive oil, canola oil and peanut oil. Polyunsaturated fats are also considered relatively healthy and include the following (ranked in order, most to least, of polyunsaturates): safflower oil, soybean oil, corn oil and sesame oil.");

Simply put, sausage is ground meat mixed with fat, salt and other seasonings, preservatives and sometimes fillers. Such a mixture is usually packed into a casing. Sausages can differ dramatically depending on their ingredients, additives, shape, curing technique, level of dryness and whether fresh or cooked. Most sausages are made with pork or pork combined with other meat, but there are also those made almost entirely from beef, veal, lamb, chicken or game animals. All contain varying amounts of fat. Seasonings can run the gamut from garlic to nutmeg. Some sausages are hot and spicy and others so mild they border on bland. Many sausages today contain additives to help preserve, thicken or color the mixture. Some sausages use fillers (such as various cereals, soybean flour and dried-milk solids) to stretch the meat. The most common shape for sausage is link, which varies in size and shape depending on the type of sausage. Other sausage (fresh) is sold in bulk, which can then be used to mix with other meats or made into patties or balls. Sausage can be fresh or cured with salt or smoke (or both). Curing extends storage life. Some sausages are also dried; the drying times can vary from a few days to as much as 6 months. The sausage becomes firmer the longer it's dried. Sausage can be fully cooked (ready to eat), partially cooked (enough to kill any trichinae) and uncooked, which may or may not require cooking depending on how or whether it's been cured. All these factors produce an almost endless number of sausages that can be used in a variety of ways and which appeal to a multitude of tastes.");

They average about 100 per pound and their meat is sweeter and more succulent than that of the sea scallop. They're also more expensive because they're less plentiful.

Though slightly chewier, the meat is still sweet and moist. <b>Diver scallops</b> is a term used for those that are hand-picked by divers, whereas traditionally scallops are harvested by trawling boats using chains and nets. The shells of hand-harvested scallops aren't damaged as they might be with trawling, and the scallops don't contain as much grit. Naturally, this relatively labor-intensive harvest method means diver scallops command higher prices. One caveat: Many fishing industry experts say that regular trawled scallops are being sold as diver scallops. Bottom line: Find a fishmonger you can trust. The color of scallops ranges from pale beige to creamy pink. If scallops are stark white, it's a sign that they've been soaked in watera marketing ploy to increase the weight. Fresh bay scallops are available on the East Coast in the fall, whereas the peak season for fresh sea scallops is midfall to midspring. Because scallops perish quickly out of water, they're usually sold shucked. All fresh scallops should have a sweet smell and a fresh, moist sheen. They should be refrigerated immediately after purchase and used within a day or two. Frozen scallops are generally available year-round, either breaded or plain.

Generally, they're divided into two categories  <em>summer squash</em> and <em>winter squash</em>. <b>Summer squash</b> have thin, edible skins and soft seeds. The tender flesh has a high water content, a mild flavor and doesn't require long cooking. The most widely available varieties of summer squash are crookneck, pattypan and zucchini. Summer squash is best from early through late summer, although some varieties are available year-round in certain regions. Select the smaller specimens with bright-colored skin free of spots and bruises. Summer squash is very perishable and should be refrigerated in a plastic bag for no more than five days. It can be prepared by a variety of methods including steaming, baking, sautéing and deep-frying. Summer squash are high in vitamins A and C as well as niacin. <b>Winter squash</b> have hard, thick skins and seeds. The deep yellow to orange flesh is firmer than that of summer squash and therefore requires longer cooking. Winter squash varieties include acorn, buttercup, butternut, hubbard, spaghetti and turban. Though most varieties are available year-round, winter squash is best from early fall through the winter. Choose squash that are heavy for their size and have a hard, deep-colored rind free of blemishes or moldy spots. The hard skin of a winter squash protects the flesh and allows it to be stored longer than summer squash. It does not require refrigeration and can be kept in a cool, dark place for a month or more, depending on the variety. Once the seeds are removed, winter squash can be baked, steamed or simmered. They're a good source of iron, riboflavin and vitamins A (more than summer squash) and C. 2. In Britain, squash is also a citrus-based soft drink.");

Pacific whiting is also beginning to be used for surimi but its flesh is so soft that it requires the addition of egg whites and potatoes to be firm enough for processing. To become surimi, fish is skinned, boned, repeatedly rinsed to eliminate any fishiness and pigment and ground into a paste. This odorless white paste is then mixed with a flavor concentrate made from real shellfish, the solution from boiled shells or artificial flavorings. The paste is then formed, cooked and cut into the various shapes of the seafood it's imitating, which in the United States is usually crab legs, lobster chunks, shrimp and scallops. Lastly, surimi is colored to complete its transformation from fish to shellfish look-alike. Surimi is available in the refrigerator or freezer section of most supermarkets. It can be kept unopened in the refrigerator for up to 2 months, in the freezer for up to 6 months. Once opened, use surimi within 3 days.

Tequilas labeled ''100% Blue Agave'' are considered the best. Mexican law states that tequila must be made with <em>at least</em> 51 percent blue agave; the remaining 49 percent is most commonly sugarcane, although other raw products may be used. Tequila is generally bottled at 80 proof although some of the aged versions are bottled at higher alcohol levels. There are four categories of tequila: <em>blanco, joven, abocado</em> and <em>añejo.</em> Tequila <b>blanco</b> (also known as <em>white, silver</em> or <em>plata</em>) is bottled soon after distillation. Its smooth, fresh flavor has an herbaceous, peppery quality. Tequila <b>joven abocado</b> (also called <em>gold</em>) is a tequila blanco with flavoring and coloring added; it doesn't have to be aged. Tequila <b>reposado</b> may also contain added flavoring and coloring and must be aged at least two months but can be aged for up to a year. The wood aging (usually in oak) endows reposados with hints of vanilla and spice and produces character more mellow than that of tequila blanco. Some reposados also use the word ''gold'' on their label, which gives the impression that golds have been aged, although there's no such legal requirement. Tequila <b>añejo</b> is aged for at least one year (and often two to three years). The smooth, elegant and complex flavor of the best añejos is often compared to that of fine cognacs. ");

It's very popular  both for eating and as a garnish  because of its bright color and excellent flavor. The yellow cherry tomato is slightly less acidic than the red and therefore somewhat blander in flavor. Though it's long been popular raw in salads, the cherry tomato is gaining favor as a cooked side dish, quickly sautéed with herbs. The <b>yellow pear tomato</b> is slightly smaller than the cherry tomato and resembles a tiny pear. It's used in the same manner as the cherry tomato. <b>Currant tomatoes</b> are the tiniest of the species, measuring only about 0.7 inches in diameter and weighing about 1⁄8 ounce. They come in both red and yellow varieties and have a sweet, crisp flesh. Finding a niche in some produce markets are several unique looking and extremely flavorful <strong>heirloom tomatoes</strong>. Among the many popular varieties are the <strong>purple tomatoes</strong> (such as <em>Purple Calabash, Brandywine</em> and <em>Cherokee Purple</em>), the skins of which can range in color from a dusky pink with purple shoulders to a dusky rose-purple. Depending on the variety, the flesh color can vary from crimson to a brownish purple-pink. <b>Bicolored and striped tomatoes</b> (such as <em>Marvel Striped, Big White Pink Stripe</em> and <em>Hillbilly</em>) have an orangey skin with faint red striations. This fruit's bicolor flesh is a brilliant yellow with a red center. Fresh tomatoes are available year-round, with the peak season from June through September. The most succulent, flavorful tomatoes are those that are ''vine-ripened,'' usually only available in specialty produce markets. Unfortunately, such tomatoes are very perishable, which is why supermarkets almost always carry tomatoes that have been picked green and ripened with ethylene gas or in special warming rooms. Such tomatoes will never have the texture, aroma and taste of the vine-ripened fruit. Choose firm, well-shaped tomatoes that are noticeably fragrant and richly colored (for their variety). They should be free from blemishes, heavy for their size and give slightly to palm pressure. Ripe tomatoes should be stored at room temperature and used within a few days. They should never be refrigerated  cold temperatures make the flesh pulpy and kill the flavor. Unripe fruit can be ripened by placing it in a pierced paper bag with an apple for several days at room temperature (65° to 75°F). Do not refrigerate or set in the sun. Tomato skins can be removed by blanching. <b>Sun-dried tomatoes</b> are, as the name indicates, dried in the sun (or by other, artificial methods). The result is a chewy, intensely flavored, sweet, dark red tomato. Sun-dried tomatoes are usually either packed in oil or dry-packed in cellophane. The dry-pack type benefits from soaking in oil or other liquid before use. Sun-dried tomatoes add their rich flavor to sauces, soups, sandwiches, salads and myriad other dishes. <b>Canned tomatoes</b> are available in various forms including peeled, whole, crushed, and those with herbs such as oregano and/or basil added. <b>Tomato paste,</b> which is available in cans and tubes, consists of tomatoes that have been cooked for several hours, strained and reduced to a deep red, richly flavored concentrate. Canned <b>tomato purée</b> consists of tomatoes that have been cooked briefly and strained, resulting in a thick liquid. <b>Tomato sauce</b> is a slightly thinner tomato purée, often with seasonings and other flavorings added so that it is ready to use in various dishes or as a base for other sauces. Tomatoes are rich in vitamin C and contain appreciable amounts of vitamins A and B, potassium, iron and phosphorus. A medium tomato has about as much fiber as a slice of whole-wheat bread and only about 35 calories.");

Though most trout are freshwater fish, some live in marine waters. When the first European settlers arrived in North America, trout were very abundant. By the late 1860s, however, a number of factors including overfishing and pollution caused the trout population to diminish drastically. By the end of the 19th century trout hatcheriesalong with other prevention and regenerative measures taken to forestall the extinction of this delicious fishwere in existence. Today trout are plentiful and vary widely in appearance and size. In general, their flesh is firm-textured with medium to high fat content. Probably the best known of the freshwater species is the <b>rainbow trout,</b> which, though native to California, has been transplanted to many different countries and is now one of the most popular varieties in the world. Rainbow trout can grow to up to 50 pounds, but most commercially raised fish average around 8 ounces. <b>Brook</b> or <b>speckled trout</b> are small (6 to 8 inches long) but considered by many as the best eating. Other popular species include <b>steelhead</b> or <b>salmon trout</b> (a largeup to 35 poundssubspecies of the rainbow trout), <b>cutthroat trout </b>and <b>brown trout. </b>Saltwater trout or sea trout species, which are generally available only on the East Coast, include <b>gray trout</b>,<b> silver trout</b>,<b> spotted trout</b> and <b>white trout. </b>Trout are available wholefresh and frozenand in fillets.

This exceptional fungus grows 3 to 12 inches underground near the roots of trees (usually oak but also chestnut, hazel and beech), never beyond the range of the branches. The difficult-to-find truffle is routed out by animals that have been specially trained for several years. Pigs have keener noses, but dogs are less inclined to gobble up the prize. Once the truffle is found, the farmer (<em>trufficulteur</em>) scrapes back the earth, being careful not to touch the truffle with his hands (which will cause the fungus to rot). If the truffle isn't ripe, it's carefully reburied for future harvesting. This methodically slow and labor-intensive harvesting method is what makes truffles so extremely expensive. Truffles have been prized by gourmets for centuries and were credited by the ancient Greeks and Romans with both therapeutic and aphrodisiac powers. A truffle has a rather unappealing appearance  round and irregularly shaped with a thick, rough, wrinkled skin that varies in color from almost black to off-white. Of the almost 70 known varieties, the most  desirable is the <b>black truffle</b>, also known as <em>black diamond,</em> of France's Périgord and Quercy regions and the Umbria region of Italy. Its extremely pungent flesh is black (really very dark brown) with white striations. The next most popular is the <b>white truffle </b>(actually off-white or beige) of Italy's Piedmont region, with its earthy, garlicky aroma and flavor. Fresh imported truffles are available from late fall to midwinter in specialty markets. Choose firm, well-shaped truffles with no sign of blemishes. Truffles should be used as soon as possible after purchase but can be stored up to three days in the refrigerator. To take full advantage of their perfumy fragrance, bury them in a container of rice or whole eggs and cover tightly before refrigerating. The scent will permeate whatever truffles are stored with, giving the cook a flavor bonus. Brush any surface dust off the truffle and peel the dark species (saving the peelings for soups). White truffles need not be peeled. Canned truffles, truffle paste in a tube and, to a limited extent, frozen truffles are also found in specialty stores. Dark truffles are generally used to flavor foods such as omelets, polentas, risottos and sauces, like the famous truffle slicer can be used to shave off paper-thin slivers and slices of truffle. Dishes flavored or garnished with truffles are often referred to as à la périgourdine. ");

The high-fat <b>albacore</b> weighs in the 10- to 60-pound range, has the lightest flesh (white with a hint of pink) and is the only tuna that can be called ''white.'' Its mild flavor and prized white flesh make it the most expensive canned tuna. <b>Yellowfin tunas</b> (also called <em>ahi</em>) are usually larger than albacores, reaching up to 300 pounds. Their flesh is pale pink (it must be called ''light''), with a flavor slightly stronger than that of the albacore. Among the largest tunas are the <b>bluefin,</b> which can weigh more than 1,000 pounds. Young bluefins have a lighter flesh and are less strongly flavored, but as they grow into adulthood, their flesh turns dark red and their flavor becomes more pronounced. The small <b>bonitos</b> rarely exceed 25 pounds. They range from moderate- to high-fat and are the most strongly flavored of the tunas. Many Japanese dishes use dried bonito, called katsuobushi. <b>Skipjack tunas</b> (also known as <em>Arctic bonito, oceanic bonito watermelon</em> and, in Hawaii, <em>aku</em>) get their name because they seem to ''skip'' out of the water. They can weigh up to 40 pounds, but are more typically ranged from  six to eight pounds. Skipjack flesh is similar to that of yellowfin tuna.

insert into Food_EN(Food_Title,Food_Name,Description) values("vanilla","vanilla","Dictionaries describe the term <em>plain-vanilla</em> as something ''simple, plain or ordinary.'' Few statements could be further from the truthfor there is definitely nothing ordinary about the seductively aromatic vanilla bean. This long, thin pod is the fruit of a luminous celadon-colored orchid (<em>vanilla planifolia</em>), which, of over 20,000 orchid varieties, is the only one that bears anything edible. Native to tropical America, the vanilla bean was cultivated and processed by the Aztecs, who used it to flavor their cocoa-based drink, <em>xocolatl,</em> later transliterated to <em>chocolatl</em>. That basic flavoring wisdom is still true today: vanilla deliciously heightens chocolate's flavor. The vanilla bean was once considered an aphrodisiac and was so rare that it was reserved for royalty. Because of the extremely labor-intensive, time-consuming process by which it's obtained, pure vanilla is still relatively expensive today. The saga begins with the orchid blossoms, which open only one day a year (and then only for a few hours). Because this particular orchid has only one natural pollinator (the Melipona bee), which cannot possibly handle the task in such a small period of time, the flower must be hand-pollinatedotherwise, no vanilla bean. After pollination, pods take six weeks to reach full size (6 to 10 inches long) and eight to nine months after that to mature. The mature pods, which must be hand-picked, are green and have none of the familiar vanilla flavor or fragrance. For that they need curing, a three- to six-month process that begins with a 20-second boiling-water bath followed by sun heating. Once the beans are hot, they're wrapped in blankets and allowed to sweat. Over a period of months of drying in the sun by day and sweating in blankets at night, the beans ferment, shrinking by 400 percent and turning their characteristic dark brown. The better grades of beans become thinly coated with a white powdery coating called <em>vanillin</em> (which is also produced synthetically). Today the three most common types of <b>vanilla beans</b> are Bourbon-Madagascar, Mexican and Tahitian. <b>Bourbon-Madagascar vanilla beans</b> come from Madagascar, off the southeast coast of Africa, and its neighbor 420 miles awaythe West Indian island of Réunion. They're rich and sweet and the thinnest of the three types of beans. About 75 percent of the world's vanilla bean supply comes from the Madagascar area. The thick <b>Mexican vanilla beans</b> come from environs surrounding Veracruz. They have a smooth, rich flavor but are scarcer than the Bourbon-Madacascar beans because most areas where the orchid once thrived are now dedicated to oil fields and orange groves. Additionally, some Mexican vanilla productsthough considerably cheaper than their U.S. supermarket counterpartsare suspect because they contain coumarin (banned by the FDA), a potentially toxic substance that can cause liver and kidney damage. Unfortunately, there's no way for the consumer to tell which Mexican vanilla products contain this toxin so the best safeguard is to buy Mexican vanilla beans from a reliable source. <b>Tahitian vanilla beans</b> are the thickest and the darkest (a blackish brown) of the three types. It's intensely aromatic, though not as flavorful as the other two types of beans. <b>Vanilla powder</b> is the whole dried bean ground until powdery. Its flavor doesn't evaporate when heated as readily as that of vanilla extract, which makes it better suited for baked goods, custards, etc. Vanilla powder is available in specialty cake decorating supply shops, some gourmet markets and through mail order. <b>Vanilla extract</b> is the most common form of vanilla used today. It's made by macerating chopped beans in an alcohol-water solution in order to extract the flavor; the mixture is then aged for several months. To meet FDA standards, <b>pure vanilla extract</b> must contain 13.35 ounces of vanilla beans per gallon during extraction and 35 percent alcohol. The resulting brown liquid is clear and richly fragrant. (There are double- and triple-strength vanilla extracts, as well as a <b>vanilla essence</b>so strong that only a drop or two is neededavailable through special suppliers by mail order.) You can count on products labeled ''natural vanilla flavor'' containing only pure vanilla extract. <b>Imitation vanilla</b> is composed entirely of artificial flavorings (most of which are paper-industry by-products treated with chemicals). It often has a harsh quality that leaves a bitter aftertaste. Pure vanilla extract is about twice as expensive as its imitation counterpart, but there's no real comparison in flavor intensity and quality, and only about half the amount is needed. Vanilla descriptions on labels can be confusing. <em>Natural vanillin</em> is a substance intrinsic to the vanilla bean, whereas <em>artificial vanillin</em> is made from wood-pulp by-products. <em>Vanilla flavoring</em> describes a blend of pure and imitation vanilla. In the United States, a label that reads <em>vanilla ice cream</em> may only be made with pure vanilla extract and/or vanilla beans, whereas <em>vanilla-flavored ice cream</em> may contain up to 42 percent artificial flavorings and <em>artificial-flavored ice cream</em> contains imitation flavorings. Vanilla extracts are readily available and vanilla beans can be found in supermarkets and most specialty food stores. Most commercial vanilla beans are Bourbon-Madagascar; Tahitian and Mexican beans (as well as better grades of Bourbon-Madagascar) are more readily available through mail order. Extracts can be stored indefinitely if sealed airtight and kept in a cool, dark place. Vanilla beans should be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, placed in an airtight jar and refrigerated. They can be stored in this manner for about six months. In order for its flavor not to dissipate, vanilla extract should be added to cooked mixtures after they've been briefly cooled. To use vanilla beans, slit them lengthwise down the center and scrape out the thousands of diminutive seeds. These seeds can be added directly to foods such as ice-cream mixtures, shortening to be used for pastry dough, sauces, etc. Homemade vanilla extract can be made by placing a split bean in a jar containing ¾ cup vodka, sealing and letting it stand for six months. Vanilla beans may also be used to make deliciously fragrant vanilla sugar. Whole beans that have been used to flavor sauces or other mixtures may be rinsed, dried and stored for reuse. Vanilla adds flavor magic to a multitude of sweet and some savory dishes.");

Vinegar has been used for centuries for everything from beverages (like shrubs), to an odor diminisher for strong foods such as cabbage and onions, to a hair rinse and softener. There are myriad vinegar varieties found in markets today, and the following are among the most commonly available. <b>Apple cider vinegar </b>(also called <em>cider vinegar)</em><b> </b>is made from fermented apple cider and has a faintly sweet apple flavor. <b>Cane vinegar</b> is based on the juice of sugarcane; it has a rich and mellow, slightly sweet flavor and golden color. <b>Distilled white vinegar </b>(or simply <em>distilled vinegar</em>) is exceedingly high in acetic acid and is very sour and rather harsh-tasting. It's often made from a grain-alcohol base. <b>Fruit vinegars</b> come in a bevy of flavors made from the juice of various fruits including raspberries, mangos and oranges. <b>Herb vinegars</b> are made by steeping fresh herbs in warm vinegar for a period of time until the vinegar is completely infused with the ingredient's flavor. Such vinegars may be based on a single herb (such as tarragon) or a combination of herbs and other flavorings (such as oregano and garlic). <b>Malt vinegar </b>is a mellow-flavored favorite in Britain, particularly with fish and chips. It's based on malted barley and sometimes colored with caramel. <b>Rice vinegar,</b> made from fermented rice, is mild, slightly sweet and used widely in Japanese and Chinese cooking. It's a key element in dishes such as sushi. <b>Wine vinegars </b>can be made from either red or white wine and can range in flavor from pleasantly pungent to rather ordinary. Two of the most highly regarded vinegar styles come from Italy and France. From Italy comes the exquisite Italian <strong>balsamic vinegar</strong>, made in and around the areas of Modena and Reggio Emilia. It's produced from white Trebbiano grapes, the must of which is cooked and concentrated until deep, dark and rich. The vinegar continues to gain its dark color and pungent sweetness from a lengthy period of aging in barrels of various woods (such as chestnut, juniper and mulberry) and in graduating sizes, from larger to smaller as the vinegar ages over a period of years. It should be noted that many balsamic vinegars contain sulfites, which are primarily added to inhibit the growth of unfavorable flavor-detracting bacteria. Balsamic vinegars range in age from young (3 to 5 years), to middle-aged (6 to 12 years) to the noble older versions, which can range from 12 to over 100 years old. By law, a vinegar labeled <em>aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena</em> must have been wood-aged for a minimum of 12 years. The word <em>stravecchio</em> on the label tells you the balsamic's been aged at least 25 years. Older, high-quality balsamics are sometimes used as an aperitif or digestif after a meal. <b>White balsamic vinegar</b> also comes from Modena, Italy, but is made by an entirely different process than classic balsamic vinegar. The grape undergoes pressurized cooking, which prevents the caramelization of both flavor and color. White balsamic vinegar is aged only 1 year in uncharred barrels, further assuring both color and flavor will remain light. It's used in food preparations where additional color is not desired. France gives us <b>Banyuls vinegar</b> (<em>le vinaigre de Banyuls</em>), which hails from the area around the seaside town of Banyuls-sur-Mer, a region wine lovers know for its unusual fortified wines. Comparing favorably with Italian balsamic vinegars and aged Spanish sherry vinegars, Banyuls begins life as one of the local wines (typically grenache) and spends five years or more maturing in oak barrels. During the final year of aging, vinegar from an older batch is added to trigger the ultimate conversion from wine to vinegar. The result is a tart blend replete with complex aromas of allspice, anise, nuts and vanilla. From the area of southern Spain around Jerez de la Frontera comes not only sherry but aged <b>sherry vinegar</b> as well. Like balsamic vinegar, some sherry vinegars are aged for years30, 50 or even 75. And though not as well known as balsamic vinegars, these aged Spanish vinegars rival many of their Italian counterparts in quality, flavor and character. Vinegar is essential in making pickles, mustards and vinaigrettes. It adds a jolt of flavor to numerous sauces, marinades and dressings, and to preparations such as sauerbraten, sweet-and-sour dishes and marinated herring. It's also widely used as a table condiment in many cultures. Vinegar should be stored airtight in a cool, dark place. Unopened, it will keep indefinitely; once opened it can be stored for about six months.");

This trait is what endears yeast to winemakers, brewmasters and bread bakers. In the making of wine and beer, the yeast's manufacture of alcohol is desired and necessary for the final product, and carbon dioxide is what makes beer and champagne effervescent. The art of breadmaking needs the carbon dioxide produced by yeast in order for certain doughs to rise. To multiply and grow, all yeast needs is the right environment, which includes moisture, food (in the form of sugar or starch) and a warm, nurturing temperature (70 to 85 degrees F is best). Wild yeast spores are constantly floating in the air and landing on uncovered foods and liquids. No one's sure when these wild spores first interacted with foods, but it's known that the Egyptians used yeast as a leavening agent more than 5,000 years ago. Wine and other fermented beverages were made for millennia before that. Today scientists have been able to isolate and identify the various yeasts that are best for winemaking, beermaking and baking. The two types commercially available are baker's yeast and brewer's yeast. <b>Baker's yeast,</b> as the name implies, is used as a leavener. It's catagorized into three basic types  active dry yeast, compressed fresh yeast and yeast starters. <b>Active dry yeast</b> is in the form of tiny, dehydrated granules. The yeast cells are alive but dormant because of the lack of moisture. When mixed with a warm liquid (105° to 115°F), the cells once again become active. Active dry yeast is available in two forms, <em>regular</em> and <em>quick-rising,</em> of which the latter takes about half as long to leaven bread. They may be used interchangeably (with adjustments in rising time) and both are available in ¼-ounce envelopes. Regular active dry yeast may also be purchased in 4-ounce jars or in bulk in some natural food stores. It should be stored in a cool, dry place, but can also be refrigerated or frozen. It should always be at room temperature before being dissolved in liquid. Properly stored, it's reliable when used by the expiration date, which should be stamped on the envelope or jar label. One package of dry yeast is equal to 1 scant tablespoon dry yeast or 1 cake of compressed fresh yeast. <b>Compressed fresh yeast,</b> which comes in tiny (0.06-ounce), square cakes, is moist and extremely perishable. It must be refrigerated and used within a week or two, or by the date indicated on the package. It can be frozen, but should be defrosted at room temperature and used immediately. One cake of fresh yeast can be substituted for one envelope of dry yeast. The use of compressed fresh yeast has been primarily replaced by the more convenient active dry yeast. All baker's yeast should be given a test called proofing to make sure it's still alive. To proof yeast, dissolve it in warm water and add a pinch of sugar. Set the mixture aside in a warm place for 5 to 10 minutes. If it begins to swell and foam, the yeast is alive, active and capable of leavening bread.  <b>Brewer's yeasts</b> are special non-leavening yeasts used in beermaking. Because it's a rich source of B vitamins, brewer's yeast is also used as a food supplement. It's available in natural food stores. Brewer's yeasts are also marketed in specialty beermaking equipment shops, with different strains used for different beers.");

South Americans have been sipping this energy-boosting brew for centuries and its popularity has now spread to points around the globe. The traditional South American way to consume yerba maté is to brew it in a hollow gourd (also called <em>maté</em> in Spanish) and share it communally by drinking it through a <em>bombilla, </em>a special metal straw that strains out the leaves. Whether brewed in a gourd or not, it's important to use hot, not boiling, water to steep this ''tea.'' Yerba maté has an earthy, herbal flavor that many have to sweeten to make it potable. Most bottled-drink versions are pre-sweetened. Gram for gram, yerba maté has the same amount of caffeine as coffee, though the energy effect is more sustainable than that of coffee. Yerba maté can be found in Latin markets, natural food stores and many supermarkets. It's also known as <em>Brazilian tea, Paraguay tea</em> and simply <em>maté.</em>");

Yogurt-making is thought to have been originated by nomadic Balkan tribes thousands of years ago, probably first by accident and then as a means of preserving milk. Today, yogurt is made commercially in carefully controlled environments and the requisite bacteria (usually <em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus </em>and <em>Streptococcus thermophilus</em>) are added to the milk. Though yogurt can be made from the milk of many animals, cow's milk is the most commonly used. There are a variety of commercial yogurts now produced. <b>Plain yogurt</b> is made from whole milk, lowfat or nonfat milk without additional flavoring ingredients. <b>Flavored yogurt</b> has sugar and either artificial flavorings or natural fruit (or both) added.
